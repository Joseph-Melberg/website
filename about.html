This website is my way of practicing quite a few things.

	<h2>On Prem</h2>

	<p>I adore 'on premise' stuff for non-commercial purposes.</p>

	<h2>Naming</h2>
	<p>When I first started the server project, I had purchase a Raspberry Pi 4 (4gb).  This device would serve as the center for all of my projects, so I named it Center</p>
	<p>Due to <a href="thanksXfinity.html">certain issues</a>, I switched to a computer that now sits in my apartment.  This is Center2.</p>
	<p>Finally, I have a HP rackmount server in my living room, running most of my services.  That one is named Center3.</p>
	<p>While i will retire the naming scheme of Center$X, I knew that it would stick around, so I decided that the website should be named Centurionx.</p>
	<p>(Another factor is that nothing else that both sounded cool and weren't rather expensive to claim was around this) </p>
