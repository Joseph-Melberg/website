	<h2>Naming</h2>
	<p>When I first started the server project, I had purchase a Raspberry Pi 4 (4gb).  This device would serve as the center for all of my projects, so I named it Center</p>
	<p>Due to <a href="thanksXfinity.html">certain issues</a>, I switched to a computer that now sits in my apartment.  This is Center2</p>
