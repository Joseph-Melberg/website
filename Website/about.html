<marquee>Did you know that this whole animation is done with a single html tag?  I don't think I've ever actually seen this used on any modern webpages.  I mean, it makes sense why it doesn't show up.  No one needs this, no one should really want this</marquee>
Listed below is some of the information relative to myself and my hobby.

	<h2>On Prem</h2>

	<p>I adore 'on premise' for non-commercial purposes.  I love the idea that the computer within arms reach is quietly spinning away, responding to requests and performing duties.
	</p>
	<p>I also recognize that some of my hobbies don't scale well in the cloud.  I enjoy coding with CUDA (Nvidia's framework for parallel code execution on Nvidia cards).
		  My goal with this is to pry as much performance out of the rather weak cards I bought (3 total GT 710's),
		   which is counter to the multiple thousands of dollars that it would cost me to use a Linode or AWS VM that is equiped with a GPU even for a few minutes.

	<h2>Naming</h2>
	<p>When I first started the server project, I had purchased a Raspberry Pi 4 (4gb).  This device would serve as the center for all of my projects, so I named it Center</p>
	<p>Due to <a href="thanksXfinity.html">certain issues</a>, I switched to a tower computer that now sits in my apartment.  This is Center2.</p>
	<p>Finally, I added a HP rackmount server in my living room, running most of my services.  That one is named Center3.</p>
	<p>While I will retire the naming scheme of Center$X, I knew that it would stick around, so I decided that the website should be named Centurionx.</p>
	<p>(Another factor is that it sounds cool and was inexpensive to claim) </p>
